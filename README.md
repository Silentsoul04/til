# Today I Learn

Learning should be open and fun and only then it
can add value. To make it fun, the learning envirionment
must be unbiased, collaborative and participative. 
Inorder to create value from learning, such environment 
is as important as the quality of the content. Therefore,
this is my way of learning where everyone is welcome 
to participate. Please do comment kindly, and contribute
as you see fit.


### About The Repository
[Issues](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues) is the main learning management system. 
The topic are mainly tech related but could be 
anything random.

The nature of issues here are supposed to short lived,
few hours or a day kind of issue but I have come to realize
that does not happen. Anyways, I wish to have short lived
issues like blog posts and brief overview of a tech stack.
For indepth study I use another account [LearnWithAnit](https://github.com/LearnWithAnit) for
learning books and online courses. This is also open sourced if you
would like participate.

If you have anything to ask, please create an [issue](https://github.com/codeanit/ama/issues).

Thank you.
