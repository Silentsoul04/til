# Today I Learned
I used to collect collect and write my daily learning at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/journey-of-a-software-engineer). Now I would like to collect the learning in Github. But I will continue to add the reosurces in Trello as well.


# [Issues](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues)
Issues will be something I am learning.
