# Today I Learn

Learning should be as much open and fun. To make 
it fun it should be collaborative, participation
is as much important as the quality of the content.
Hence this is my way of open learning. Therefore, 
everyone is welcome participate. Comment kindly,
and contribute as you see fit.


### About The Repository
[Issues](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues) is the main learning management system. 
The topic are mainly tech related but could be 
anything random.

I wish to have short issues lived issues like blog 
posts and brief overview of a tech stack. For indepth
study I use another account [LearnWithAnit](https://github.com/LearnWithAnit) for
learning books and online courses. This is also open sourced if you
would like participate.

If you have anything to ask, please create an [issue](https://github.com/codeanit/ama/issues).

Thank you.
