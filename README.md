# Today I Learn

I am using [Issues](https://github.com/codeanit/til/issues)
as a learning management tool.

Previously, I used to collect the information at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/journey-of-a-software-engineer)
and other places like Google Documents, Dropbox and
local files. All of them have their use-cases but 
I find `issues` more suitable for my purpose.

This repository contains things I learn on a daily basis.
The contents are mostly tech-stuffs but there might be 
anything as my interest varies and it also depends on the
content that I find which could just anything. Well I'm
open to learning and understanding things in life as they 
come. So this is my open-sourced open-minded way of knowledge
sharing. Therefore, everyone is welcome. Please do participate.
Comment as you see fit.

The issues here will be as much possible related to
short topics. For more detailed learning like books,
massive online open source courses or any other topics
that takes more time I use another account [LearnWithAnit](https://github.com/LearnWithAnit).

The repository many not contain files but I look forward to
convert the issues into contains according to their topics. 

If you have anything to ask, please create an [issue](https://github.com/codeanit/ama/issues).

Thank you.
