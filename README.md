This is a collection of things I am learning in the for of issues.

I used to collect collect and write my daily learning at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/GGhug4Bh/journey-of-a-software-engineer). Now I would like to collect the learning in Github.

This is my personal learning space and is opensourced with the objective for someone else wants to find something with similar interest.
